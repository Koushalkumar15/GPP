## Abstract:

Waste Management in Indian cities has emerged as a major concern over the past few years. The rise in urban population and economic growth in the absence of an effective management mechanism has manifested in the current state of solid waste management in Indian cities which is far from perfect. Given the present situation, the quantum of waste generated in cities, especially larger ones with the higher population is expected to increase. Greater attention needs to be paid towards devising appropriate and effective mechanisms for waste treatment and disposal in urban centers. And monitor the use of banned plastic.

For which our government started the swachh Bharat Abhiyan which orders all the societies to segregate the waste as dry, wet, and e-waste. But still, many societies are not following this. Many citizens don't know whether the waste generated at their homes is to be disposed of in a dry dustbin or a wet dustbin.


We have planned to develop a solution using artificial intelligence and image processing which helps the government and the civic bodies to closely monitor the societies in any locality are segregating the disposed waste or not. And accordingly, rate these localities and take necessary actions against them. We have developed a gamified version for citizens to identify if to dispose of the waste in a dry or waste dustbin and earn coins to redeem vouchers. If all waste is segregated at every household then it will automatically be segregated at the local level.
